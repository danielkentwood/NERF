% trials2mongo.m - Code to take the Trials data structure and hopefully
%                  convert it or import it into a MongoDB format.

% Motivation: MATLAB is difficult and not really a great option for 
%             storing massive amounts of data. We think this might make
%             it easier to work with things in a more structured way
%             down the line.

% TODO: Install MongoDB on the computer so we can work with it.
